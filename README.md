Liver Disease Prediction
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts liver disease based on various health metrics.

Description
The model.py file contains the Python code for the model. The model uses a dataset of Indian patients and their various health metrics to predict whether or not a patient has liver disease. The dataset is preprocessed, and then a logistic regression model is trained on 70% of the data and tested on the remaining 30%. The model's accuracy is then printed.
